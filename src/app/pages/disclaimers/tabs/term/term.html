    <h4>17. Termination</h4>
    <p>This Agreement is effective until terminated.

PwC may terminate or suspend your use of the Solution at any time and without prior notice, for any reason, including if PwC believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement.

  </div>
  <div class="part">
    <h4>18. Governing Law; Arbitration</h4>
    <p>This Agreement, and any dispute relating to this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement, will be governed by and construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any provisions that would require the laws of another jurisdiction to apply and regardless of your location.  The parties expressly disclaim the applicability of, and waive any rights based on, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, the Uniform Commercial Code, or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, however each may be codified or amended.  all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement (including the Solution and the use thereof) or any aspect of the relationship between you and PwC under this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral panel of three arbitrators instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that PwC and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in a class action.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude either party from seeking equitable relief in a court having jurisdiction.  The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration of the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution then in effect (“CPR Rules”).  The arbitration will be conducted before a panel of three arbitrators selected using the screened process provided for in the CPR Rules.  The arbitration panel will have no power to award non-monetary or equitable relief of any sort, or to award damages inconsistent with this Agreement (including Section 16).  Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  All aspects of the arbitration will be treated as confidential.  You acknowledge and agree that any demand for arbitration must be issued within one (1) year from the date that you became aware or should reasonably have become aware of the facts that give rise to PwC’s alleged liability and in any event no later than two (2) years after the cause of action accrued.</p>

    <h4>21. Copyright Infringement Claims</h4>
    <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Solution infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send to PwC a written notice by mail, e-mail or fax, requesting that PwC remove such material or block access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send to PwC a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. See http://www.copyright.gov/ for details. Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing to Taylor Davis, PwC’s DMCA agent, as follows: By mail to Taylor Davis, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Three Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, CA, 94111-4004; by e-mail to taylor.l.davis@pwc.com; or by fax to 415-498-7100.
